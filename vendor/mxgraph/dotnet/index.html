<h1>mxGraph .NET</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
	The following assumes that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vwd/">Microsoft Visual Web Developer 2008</a>
	(Express Edition) is used for development. To start development, open the
	solution file <code>mxgraph-dotnet.sln</code> in Visual Web Developer by
	choosing File, Open File.
</p>
<p>
	To run the ASP.NET examples in IIS, a virtual directory must be created
	that maps /mxgraph to the top-level directory of this distribution.
</p>
<p>
	Note that web.config defines a text/plain MIME type for the
	<code>.properties</code> extension. This extension should always be
	registered for use with mxGraph resource files.
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Clients</h3>
<p>
	The <i>examples</i> project demonstrates various aspects of the API, such
	as creating images, using input/output or placing a graph image in a form.
	Go to Debug, Start without Debugging (Ctrl-F5) to run the examples in this
	project.
</p>
<h3>Servers</h3>
<p>
	The <i>aspnet</i> project demonstrates various scenarios using mxGraph,
	ASP.NET and IIS. Go to Build, Publish to deploy these examples and point
	your browser to <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a> for all
	examples in this project. (You may have to use the application name you
	specified in the Deploy dialog in the URL.)
</p>
<p>
	Note that the Server examples require a virtual directory to be created in
	IIS. The directory should map /mxgraph to the top-level directory of the
	distribution and needs to define a mime type of text/plain for .properties
	files.
</p>
<p>
	In order to publish the example to IIS, you must run Visual Studio in the
	context of an administrator account.
</p>
<p>
	This example requires a managed runtime version of 4.0 in Visual Web
	Developer 2010. See <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754523(WS.10).aspx">here</a>
	on how to change the managed runtime version in IIS.
