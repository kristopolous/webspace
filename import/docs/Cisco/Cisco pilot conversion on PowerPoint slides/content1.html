          LAN, where the star topology is used, the networking media is run from
          a central hub out to each device attached to the network. </font>The physical layout of the
        star topology resembles spokes radiating from the hub of a wheel. <img border="0" src="../../images/1.gif" align="baseline" width="12" height="12"></font>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">As the graphic shows, a central point of control is used in
        a star topology. When a star topology is used, communication between devices attached to
        the local area network is via point-to-point wiring to the central link or hub. All
        network traffic in a star topology passes through the hub. <br>
        <br>
        The hub receives frames on a port, then copies and transmits (repeats) the frame to all of
        the other ports. The hub can be either active or passive. An active hub connects the
        networking media as well as regenerates the signal. In Ethernet where hubs act as
        multiport repeaters, they are sometimes referred to as concentrators. By regenerating the
        signal, active hubs enable data to travel over greater distances. A passive hub is a
        device used to connect networking media and does not regenerate a signal.<br>
        <br>
        One of the star topology&#146;s advantages is that it is considered the easiest to design
        and install. This is due to the networking media being run directly out from a central hub
        to each workstation area. Another advantage is its ease of maintenance since the only area
        of concentration is located at the hub. In a star topology, the layout used for the
        networking media is easy to modify and troubleshoot. Workstations can be easily added to a
        network employing a star topology. If one run of networking media is broken or shorted, then
        only the device attached at that point is out of commission, the rest of the LAN will
        remain functional. In short, a star topology means greater reliability.<br>
        <br>
        In some ways a star topology's advantages can also be considered disadvantages. For
        example, while limiting one device per run of networking media can make diagnosis of
        problems easier, it also increases the amount of networking media required, which adds to
        the setup costs. And, while the hub can make maintenance easier, it represents a single
        point of failure (if the hub breaks, everyone's network connection is lost).

          <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">TIA/EIA-568-A specifies
          that the physical layout, or topology that is to be used for
          horizontal cabling, must be a star topology.</font>
        <img border="0" src="../../images/3.gif" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12"> 
          This means
        the mechanical termination for each telecommunications outlet/connector is located at the
        patch panel in the wiring closet. Every outlet is independently and directly wired to the
        patch panel.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The TIA/EIA-568-A specification, for the maximum length of horizontal cabling for
        unshielded twisted pair cable, is 90 m. <img border="0" src="../../images/4.gif" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">
        The maximum
        length for patch cords at the telecommunications outlet/connector is 3 m, and the maximum
        length for patch cords/jumpers at the horizontal cross-connect is 6 m. <br>
        <br>
        The maximum distance for a run of horizontal
        cabling, that extends from the hub to any workstation, is 100 m. <img border="0" src="../../images/5.gif" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">
        (actually 99 m. but it is
        commonly rounded up to 100 m.) This figure includes the 90 meters for the horizontal
        cabling, the 3 meters for the patch cords, and the 6 meters for the jumpers at the
        horizontal cross-connect. Horizontal cabling runs in a star topology radiate
        out from the hub, much like the spokes of a wheel. This means that a LAN
          that uses a star topology could cover the area of a circle with a
          radius of 100 m. <img border="0" src="../../images/6.gif" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12"><br>
        <br>
          There will be times when the area to be covered by a network will exceed the
          TIA/EIA-568-A specified maximum length that a simple star topology can accommodate.
          For example, envision a building where the dimensions are 200 m x 200 m.
          <img border="0" src="../../images/7.gif" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="12">
          A simple star topology that adhered to the horizontal cabling standard specified by
          TIA/EIA-568-A could not provide complete coverage for that building.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
          As indicated in the Figure <img border="0" src="../../images/8.gif" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">, workstations E, F, and C are located outside the area that can be covered by a star topology that adheres to
          TIA/EIA-568-A specifications. As shown, they are not part of the local area network. So users at these workstations wanting to send, share, and receive files, would have to use
          sneakernet. <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">Because no one
          wants to return to the days of sneakernet, some cable installers are
          tempted to solve the problem of a star topology's inadequate coverage
          by extending the length of the networking media beyond the TIA/EIA-568-A
          specified maximum length.</font> &nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        When signals first leave a transmitting station, they are clean and easily recognizable.
        However, the longer the cable length, the weaker and more deteriorated the signals become
        as they pass along the networking media. <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">If
          a signal travels beyond the specified maximum distance, there is no
          guarantee that when it reaches a NIC card, the NIC card will be able
          to read it.</font>  </font><img border="0" src="../../images/9.gif" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">
          </p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If a star topology cannot provide enough coverage
        for an area to be networked, the network can be extended through the use of
        internetworking devices that do not result in attenuation of the signal. This resulting
        topology is designated as an extended star topology. By using repeaters, the distance over
        which a network can operate is extended. <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">Repeaters
        take in weakened signals, regenerate and retime them, and send them back out onto
        the network.</font> <img border="0" src="../../images/10.gif" align="absmiddle" width="20" height="12"></font>
