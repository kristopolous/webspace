The purpose of this project is to try to navigate deep thoughts.

There is a problem with the document based approach to the world wide web. 

I should probably write more about this here but really I'm going to use this space to talk about what I need to do.

So the actual goal here is a navigable wikipedia space where spacial relationships are consistent.  There's mind-map node demos where objects seem to be in random relationships forming nice animations. That's not what this is.  This is intended to be purely functional.

There's something deep about spacial memory. Animals know where they left things, where they can find food, and can navigate the spacial landscape. Spacial reasoning is pre-language and many mammals communicate about space and territory.

Anyway, so here's some of the goals.

I'm using the en wikipedia database dumps (https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html) and eventually there should be an interface with a search box and search results in a conventional manner to find a starting point.

But then after clicking on the starting point, things are going to be arranged in the "viz-language" specifications found in this document.

Cross-linked documents will exist as distinct spacial navigable areas that can be traversed like paths along a journey.
